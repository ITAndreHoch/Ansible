# Ansible
 **Installation:**
 yum install ansible
 
 
 **Configuration:**
 
 Managing servers:
 /etc/ansible/hosts
 
 Example:
 The inventory file can be in one of many formats, depending on the inventory plugins you have. For this example, the format for /etc/ansible/hosts is an INI-like (one of Ansibleâ€™s defaults) and looks like this:
```
mail.example.com

[webservers]
foo.example.com
bar.example.com

[dbservers]
one.example.com
two.example.com
three.example.com
```
The headings in brackets are group names, which are used in classifying systems and deciding what systems you are controlling at what times and for what purpose.

A YAML version would look like:
```
all:
  hosts:
    plpvmail01.proview.int:
  children:
    apphosts:
      hosts:
        plwawapp18:
    dbservers:
      hosts:
         plwawdev04:
         plwawdev05:
```

TEst ping:
# su - ansible
